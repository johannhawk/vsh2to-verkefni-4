	<article><h2>Article - Complex Selectors</h2>
			Selectors are one of, if not, the most important parts of CSS. They shape the cascade and determine how styles are to be applied to elements on a page.
			<br><br>
			Up until recently the focus of CSS never really touched on selectors. Occasionally there would be incremental updates within the selectors specification, but never any real ground breaking improvements. Fortunately, more attention has been given to selectors as of late, taking a look at how to select different types of elements and elements in different states of use.
			<br>
			<br>
			CSS3 brought new selectors, opening a whole new world of opportunities and improvements to existing practices. Here we’ll discuss selectors, old and new, and how to best put them to use.<br>

	<aside class="a1"><h2>Aside1 - Common Selectors</h2>
			Before diving too deep into some of the more complex selectors, and those offered within CSS3, let’s take a quick look at some of the more common selectors seen today. These selectors include the type, class, and ID selectors.
			<br><br>
			The type selector identifies an element based on its type, specifically how that element is declared within HTML. The class selector identifies an element based on its class attribute value, which may be reused on multiple elements as necessary to help share popular styles. Lastly, the ID selector identifies an element based on its ID attribute value, which is unique and should only be used once per page.</aside>
	<aside class="a2"><h2>Aside2 - Descendant Selector</h2>
		The most common child selector is the descendant selector, which matches every element that follows an identified ancestor. The descendant element does not have to come directly after the ancestor element inside the document tree, such as a parent-child relationship, but may fall anywhere within the ancestor element. Descendant selectors are created by spacing apart elements within a selector, creating a new level of hierarchy for each element list.

<footer><h2>Footer - Selector Speed & Performance</h2><div class="">It is important to pay attention the speed and performance of selectors, as using too many intricate selectors can slow down the rendering of a page. Be attentive and when a selector begins to look a bit foreign think about revisiting it, and seeing if a better solution can be found.</div>
